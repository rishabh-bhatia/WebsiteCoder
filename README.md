This is a website made by me for new Front End Web developers to write HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript code and see their outputs in real time. 
This website was not hosted as use of JavaScript is being allowed which poses a security threat in case it's hosted.

In case you experience issues with the website, update the JavaScript source from the JQuery webpage.
